## My process

This project includes two main sections: the "rating-state" and the "thank-you-state." 

Defined HTML structure

Applied CSS styles 

Added JavaScript Interactivity

Refined


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This was my first attempt at a project using all 3 HTML, CSS, and JS. 

My biggest take away has to be the manipulation of HTML elements from JS.


### Continued development

Moving forward all projects should include some JS

Thanks for reading, happy coding!
